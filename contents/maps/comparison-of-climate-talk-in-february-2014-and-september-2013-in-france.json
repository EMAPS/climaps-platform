Node position is determined by a force vector algorithm in Gephi (Jacomy et al., forthcoming) bringing together terms directly or indirectly linked, and keeping away terms with fewer co-occurrences. Node size is proportional to their frequency in the corpus. Node color follows the clusters identified by the clustering algorithm. The names of the clusters have been attributed manually. Adaptation themes, whilst fewer than those of mitigation, are central.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>",
