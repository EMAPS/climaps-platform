Nodes represent the countries/UNFCCC groups of countries, and edges the flow of committed money. The donor countries represented are only OECD member countries. The spatialization of the nodes enables to account for the relative proximity between donor countries and recipient countries/UNFCCC groups, thus showing the affinities between them. Outside the central cluster of countries, non-conformist affinities can be observed, based on the allocation decisions taken by donor countries. The map proposes two alternative views : the recipient countries can be visualized individually, or agreggated in UNFCCC negotiating groups they belong to.</p>",

The nodes representing the countries and edges representing the flow of adaptation money are sized by the cummulative amount of bilateral adaptation money committed from 2010 to 2012, according to the OECD database. Thus only OECD member countries&rsquo; bilateral adaptation aid has been taken into account.</p><p ></p><p >The network is spatialised automatically in so as to pull closer countries which exchange more adaptation money, and, reversly, to take apart countries that exchange less adaptation money, or no money at all.</p><p ></p><p >Then two views are possible.</p><p ></p><p >The first one shows recipient countries assembled by UNFCCC groupings. One should be careful to the fact that recipient countries belong to several groups, thus the money received by each country is double-counted in each group they belong to. The number of members of each group is shown by the color of the node, whereas the amount of committed money to the group is shown by the size of the node.</p><p ></p><p >The second view shows individual recipient countries. The basemap used is the spatialization of the preceding view i.e. the donor counries are kept at the same place.</p>",

We identified aid that was labelled through the RioMarkers and selected only projects that had been categorised with adaptation aid as their principal objective. &nbsp;As the RioMarker &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; was implemented in 2010, we have only used data beginning from that year in order to identify adaptation-related projects. We summed the amounts of USD committed and adjusted for inflation for the three years between 2010 and 2012.</p><p ></p><p ></p><p >First View</p><p ></p><p >We grouped the adaptation aid of every donor country committed to particular UNFCCC negotiating groups, by summing up the amount of money committed to each member of the group. Both donor countries and recipient groups are represented as nodes nodes in a network, where edges represent the amount of total committed money from the donor country to the UNFCCC group. We used the spatialization software Gephi, which through a force-vectors algorithm, attributes a position to each node by simulating a system of physical forces in which nodes are attributed a repellent force that drives them apart, while the edges work as spring bounding nodes pulling them together. Once the balance of forces is reached, the distance amongst the nodes becomes meaningful: two nodes are closer the more they are connected to the same neighbors. </p><p ></p><p >Not all UNFCCC groupings are represented : under the guidance of issue experts, we have selected those which appeared to have a geopolitical relevance.</p><p ></p><p >Second View</p><p ></p><p >The alternative view breaks down the first one back to individual recipient countries. The spatialization is based on the first view though : the nodes representing the donor countries have been fixed in the position they occupy in the first view. The nodes representing the recipient countries have been spatialized using the force-vectors algorithm again.</p>",

One of the biases of this network visualization is that the smaller contributors have a tendancy to be rejected on the margins of the map. This is the case of the United States, as they report few adaptation aid to OECD DAC, which are located far away from the central cluster. Its closest receiving grouping are the League of Arab States and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its closest donor neighbour, Greece.</p><p ></p><p >Yet, some big contributors are also located outside the central cluster : Ireland and the Uk (which are close to each other), Canada and Germany. Germany is much closer to the G77 and the African group, than to the LDC.</p><p ></p><p >Another non-conformist choice is that of Luxemburg, closest to the Central Asia, Caucasus and Moldova&rdquo; group.</p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p>",
