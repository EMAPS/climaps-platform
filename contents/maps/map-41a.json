Tittles and metadata of best-selling books associated with each of the approaches are captured from Amazon.com and visualized as co-word network graphs. The most often occuring keywords in these networks are referred to as best-selling issues and are read as an indication of the aspects of the climate change debate that reach and resonate more in mainstream literature. A comparative analysis reveals which different aspects, places and vocabularies about climate change do well in the market and appeal to readers.</span></p><p class=\"c8 c0 c4\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c0 c4 c12\"><span>Adaptation literature is focused on the areas management, strategy and science, and connected to the environment, policy and the human aspects of climate change.

As</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c9\">titles synthesize the main ideas and orientation of a text, and signal the importance of the particular topics, they are an appropriate object to study. The inclusion of the Best Sellers Rank on the analysis adds, to what would otherwise be an analysis of media production, the element of consumption, and locates the formating of a debate as taking place in within a &lsquo;marketplace for issues&rsquo; where some are more popular and therefore rank higher.</span><span class=\"c5\">&nbsp;</span><span>Being ranked as a best-selling product is used as metric or indication of the uptake and positive resonance of a topic with a specific public.</span></p><p class=\"c0 c10\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>In the network graph nodes are the words captured book titles and an edge appears between words when they have been mentioned together at least once.
