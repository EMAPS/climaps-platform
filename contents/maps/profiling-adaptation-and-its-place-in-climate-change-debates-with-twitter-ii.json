The network displays clusters focused on the two main approaches to dealing with the impacts of climate change, which are adaptation and mitigation. The visualization further reveals a number of dense clusters and some smaller more dispersed clusters. The particularly dense clusters reflect a localized take on the issue of climate change, centered on political events. Different metrics of vulnerability also find their way as important topics in the network, including international clusters, driven by instances of extreme weather as well as intergovernmental climate change conferences and similar events. </p><p ></p>",

We identified hashtag clusters in the climate change Twitter space through a co-hashtag network analysis performed in Gephi using the modularity class algorithm and OpenOrd layout, and further manually annotated the clusters along with a close reading of the actual tweets to verify the different themes. The result is an annotated map of clusters which shows the top issues in the climate change space on Twitter.</p><p ></p><p ></p>",
