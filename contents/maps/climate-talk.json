To be able to make several different comparisons, the files were put through the tool individually, as well as grouped by year as a total, and grouped by year and reach (national or local). After manually reading through comments and testing queries for their effectiveness, we decided on the following queries as the basis of our research:</span></p><ul class=\"c9 lst-kix_hdk6jjm4qj7f-0 start\"><li class=\"c5 c1\"><span class=\"c4\">[tempete]</span></li><li class=\"c1 c5\"><span class=\"c4\">[climat OR rechauffement]</span></li></ul><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c4\">While the French terms temp&ecirc;te and r&eacute;chauffement use accents, the tool was programmed to recognise the spelling with and without accents. </span></p><p class=\"c1 c3\"><span class=\"c4\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c4\">For this map, the words and their frequency were gathered using the Comment Analysis tool, this time only querying &lsquo;climatique&rsquo; or &lsquo;rechauffement&rsquo;. The query was slightly changed from &lsquo;climat&rsquo; to &lsquo;climatique&rsquo; to lose the overrepresentation of the Ukraine in the earlier dataset. </span></p><p class=\"c1 c3\"><span class=\"c4\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>The Netvizz tool has a functionality that returns words that are used in close proximity to the query. After looking at the lists of words that the tool created with this functionality, we decided on four categories to group the words into: Weather, Climate, (Inter)national/Politics, and Personal/Local.</span></p>",
