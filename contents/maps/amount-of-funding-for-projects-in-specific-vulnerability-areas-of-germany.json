Thus it was decided to do this only for selected regions: two highly vulnerable natural areas (Upper Rhine Rift and North-East German Lowland) are selected to analyse their funding situation, and in order to have a good comparison, an additional region with lower vulnerability (West German Lowland Bay) was chosen to collect funding data for (figure 2).</span></p><p class=\"c0 c5\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c2 c5\"><span>Funding data for the three selected natural areas manually collected for most of the projects by considering the following sources: Google (Web search), UFORDAT (German environment-related projects), Federal Government (BMBF, BMUB, other Federal Ministries), INTERREG (only projects with German participation), CORDIS (EU projects, 5th, 6th, 7th FP and others).</span></p><p class=\"c0 c5\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span>Projects can be related to more than one country, and to more than one natural area of Germany. In case a project is associated to more countries, we assumed an even division of funding among countries, so we divided the total amount of money by the number of countries involved. Then we did the same in the case of projects associated to more natural areas, dividing the resulting amount of funding allocated to Germany by the number of natural areas of Germany involved in the project. &nbsp;</span></p>",

      "html": "<p class=\"c2\"><span>Looking at figure 2 the map does not draw a clear picture as, e. g., the total amount of research funding in the North-East German Lowland (high vulnerability) was almost the same than in the West German Lowland Bay (medium vulnerability). In comparison to the projects funded in the Upper Rhine Rift the figures in the latter case show that there were not only less but obviously also smaller projects funded.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span>The map on &ldquo;adaptation projects per natural area&rdquo; (figure 1) indicates that in general, projects are evenly distributed also in the natural areas &ndash; with exception of the Baltic Sea Coast and the Alpine Foothills. This was further proven by the map &ldquo;amount of funding for projects in specific areas&rdquo; map (figure 2) which shows that highly vulnerable areas do not specially get funded more.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span>When looking at the type and character of the projects in the KomPass data base we have to consider, however, that the reverse position of vulnerable areas receiving too less attention should also not be made. The reason is that many research projects &ndash; although having an adaptation context &ndash; were fundamental research projects on concepts and methodologies or pure vulnerability assessments rather than projects to implement adaptation measures. And of course, those projects were not necessarily carried out in only the most vulnerable regions. It would be interesting though to make this exercise for the projects to be funded in the future, based on the results of the new vulnerability study to be published in 2015.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p>",
