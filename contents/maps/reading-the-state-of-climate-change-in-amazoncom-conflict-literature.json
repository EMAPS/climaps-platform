As</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c5\">titles synthesize the main ideas and orientation of a text, and signal the importance of the particular topics, they are an appropriate object to study. The inclusion of the Best Sellers Rank on the analysis adds, to what would otherwise be an analysis of media production, the element of consumption, and locates the formating of a debate as taking place within a &lsquo;marketplace for issues&rsquo; where some are more popular and therefore rank higher.</span><span class=\"c4\">&nbsp;</span><span>Being ranked as a best-selling product is used as metric or indication of the uptake and positive resonance of a topic with a specific public.</span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c9\"><span>In the network graph nodes are the words captured in book titles and an edge appears between words when they have been mentioned together at least once.
