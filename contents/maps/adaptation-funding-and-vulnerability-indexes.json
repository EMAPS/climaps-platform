The selected indices were Germanwatch&rsquo;s Climate Risk Index (CRI), DARA&rsquo;s Climate Vulnerability Monitor (CVM) and the Global Adaptation Initiative&rsquo;s Global Adaptation Index (GAIN). In addition to these vulnerability indices, the United Nation&rsquo;s Human Development Index (HDI) was also added upon the suggestion of subject matter expert, Matthew <a  href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.digitalmethods.net%2Fbin%2Fedit%2FDmi%2FMcKinnon%3Ftopicparent%3DDmi.EmapsAmsterdamSprint2014Project4UsesAndUsersOfVulnerabilityIndexes&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsU5Wf00rj1mzXkqbSKpq5LsyCAg\">Mc Kinnon</a>&nbsp;(United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and editor of DARA&#39;s Climate Vulnerability Monitor). In the case of adaptation funding, the HDI is particularly interesting as it is a more established index (developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990) and might be considered less controversial than the vulnerability indices as a premise for adaptation funding. The HDI was also used to test our assumption that adaptation aid could correspond to development aid. Using the HDI in this way, we would expect to see a high correlation between the HDI and adaptation funding and vulnerability. </p><p ></p><p >These indices concerning vulnerability (and development) could thus be correlated with the four multilateral adaptation funds, the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), the Adaptation Fund (AF), the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR). The index rankings were transformed into a consistent scale for comparability and the totals for multilateral funding for each country produced.</p>",

      "html": "<p >Adaptation to climate change suggests that we need to transform how we think about and undertake development and spatial planning both at the global level (e.g. funding) and at the local level (e.g. design and implementation) in the face of expected impacts. Before that can happen, however, the question arises: the impacts of what? Anthropogenic climate change exclusively? Or climate variability at large? If adapting means addressing vulnerabilities, then how can we distinguish between the importance of climatic stimuli and socio-economic and environmental sensitivities defining the impacts of climate change? In what way is adapting to climate change impacts different from development actions that address some of the most important factors of vulnerability: poverty and lack of governance capacity. Is the question of adaptation intrinsically tied to the problem of development in poor and emerging countries, and to questions of infrastructure, land use and urban planning in more developed countries? </p><p >Is adaptation funding the perpetuation of development funding with a different label? How is vulnerability taken into account in defining criteria for allocating the funds? </p><p ></p><p >We decided to map the vulnerability of different countries according to different indices against the funds allocated to them by four multilateral mechanisms for climate change adaptation. It is important to stress that these indices were not specifically developed to support decision making on the question of adaptation funding, and there is no evidence to suggest that this is indeed the way in which they are being actively used. What the mapping does show, however, is how the priorities of different adaptation funds align with different ways of assessing vulnerability to climate change. </p><p ></p><p >We found strong positive correlations between the priorities of the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDC) and both the Human Development Index (HDI), the Global Adaptation Index (GAIN), DARA&rsquo;s Climate Vulnerability Monitor (CVI). In general these were the strongest correlations we found. Germanwatch&rsquo;s Climate Risk Indicator (CRI), however, was slightly negatively correlated with the priorities of the LDC. We found negative correlations between the priorities of the Adaptation Fund and both the HDI and the GAIN, and to a lesser extent the (CVI). Whereas there were no significant correlation between the priorities of the Special Climate Change Fund (SCC) and the GAIN, we found strong negative correlations with the CVI and the HDI, and a smaller positive correlation with the CRI. The priorities of the Pilot Programme had a positive correlation with the CVI, but did not correlate with any of the other indices. In general, if you look at the total amount of adaptation funds allocated through the four mechanisms, there are positive correlations with the GAIN, the CVI, and the HDI.</p><p ></p><p >There are many potential interpretations of these findings. The Least Developed Countries Fund was set up specifically to address the problem of low adaptive capacity in the least developed countries. It is therefore perhaps less surprising that the priorities of the fund aligns rather well with the Human Development Index. But what the differences in alignment between the LDC fund and the three climate specific vulnerability indices also shows is the different approaches to the assessment of vulnerability to climate change. Adaptive capacity is one of the areas where the overlap between adaptation and development imperatives are strongest. More developed countries tend to have higher adaptive capacity, and so it can be argued that being least developed is in itself to be vulnerable to climate change. Wheres Germanwatch&rsquo;s Climate Risk Index, wich correlates negatively with the priorities of the LDC fund, does include socio-economic costs, it does not include forward looking paramters. It is in other words based on a meassurement of who suffers from natural disasters, and not on who will have more or less adaptive capacity in the future. It seems that this approach to vulnerability assessment overlap significantly less with development imperatives than the approaches adopted in indices like the GAIN or the CVI.</p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p>",
