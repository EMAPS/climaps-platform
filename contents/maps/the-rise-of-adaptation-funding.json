Against each COP we can see the amount pledged to each part of the world divided into regions. (Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia, &nbsp;Asia and Pacific, as well as Global and Unknown). By looking at each stack (bar on the chart) we can see how much is givent to each area by the colour coding as well as the total amount.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span>Along the bottom of the map key events are given, corresponding to when they happened.
