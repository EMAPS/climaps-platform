The more red a country&rsquo;s scale is, the more funding is going to highly vulnerable ranked countries. </span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c6\"></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c6\">The visualisation shows that most countries providing bilateral aid have a fairly balanced approach. In terms of the most significant findings per index, bilateral funding data compared with the Germanwatch index indicates that Japan is granting the most adaptation funding, but this is mostly to countries ranking as having medium or low vulnerability. This suggests that the granting of funding does not necessarily just relate to the vulnerability of the country, and may also relate to the geopolitical interests of the donor. The DARA index however, indicates that many donor countries are donating small amounts of funding, but frequently to high vulnerability countries. The GAIN index and HDI also indicate this trend, leading to the assumption that vulnerability funding may be development aid by another name.</span></p>",

This data is visualised per index. Here the four indices are shown as lines of donors. The colour represents high vulnerability on a temperature scale with red indicating the most vulnerable, and green the least. Notably, not all countries are represented on the index, as some go to country groupings such as small island nations.</span></p>",

The decisions and frameworks that guide these funding mechanisms are even more opaque. Developed countries follow their own strategies which can be very different </span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span>Despite this data on bilateral funding is available for most donor countries, this is collected on the Climate Funds Update website. By comparing this to the same four indexes as the multilateral funds we can begin to see if the priorities of donors matches any of the indexes assessments of vulnerability. </span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span>Overall we find that there are few strong correlations with vulnerability indexes. Donor countries mix their adaptation between high, medium and low vulnerability countries. A few countries align with particular indexes, Canada with the DARA index and to a lesser extent Germanwatch index for instance. </span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span>What is striking from this map is the volume of funding which is not going to a single country. Looking at the data the grey &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; funds are predominantly going to regional groupings, such as the &lsquo;West Indies&rsquo; or it is simply unspecified. </span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span>There are a number of ways these findings could be interpreted. It seems however that the splitting of funds amongst vulnerable countries and favouritism of regional funding suggests that bilateral funding has motivations other than addressing pure vulnerability. Funder countries may split their funding across countries and regions to increase their influence, to get more &lsquo;bang for their buck&rsquo;.</span></p>",
