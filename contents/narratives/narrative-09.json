In particular the report notes that adaptation has become a central area of research and the volume of literature devoted to impacts and climate change adaptation has more than doubled between 2005 and 2010 (p. 2)</span><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\">. </span></p><p class=\"c1 c10 c19\"><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1 c19\"><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\">In spite of the increasing volume of literature, adaptation to climate change is far from a settled matter. Multiple controversies regarding which regions and sectors will be more affected, how funding to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change is disbursed, who generates these funds, how vulnerability to a changing climate is defined, and which mechanisms are set in place to implement adaptation policies, are at the heart of debates about this intricate issue (Fussel presentation Amsterdam, Yamin presentation Paris, Klein presentation Paris).</span></p><p class=\"c1 c19 c10\"><span class=\"c13 c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1 c19\"><span class=\"c13 c8 c11\">These responses are not chronological and </span><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\">their boundaries and substance are not </span><span class=\"c13 c8 c11\">a matter of consensus. On the contrary, they are </span><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\">elaborated into matters of public concern </span><span class=\"c13 c8 c11\">by heterogenous networks of institutions, actors and associated issues. These networks extend beyond </span><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\">climate science and global policy summits and into social media, science fiction and NGOs, and are </span><span class=\"c13 c8 c11\">sometimes in competition with each other. Thus, </span><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\">what climate change as a public concern is, stretches beyond climate science and becomes entangled with user-generated content, tweets, hashtags, comments, hyperlinks and the information politics of mediating online devices and services. These are all participating in shaping the public understanding of climate change and thus become a rich dataset for studying this issue.</span><span class=\"c8 c11\">Our aim is not to enquire </span><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\">into the veracity of the narratives put forth by different information spaces, definitions and statements that circulate (as these responsibilities lay elsewhere), but instead to trace the manufacturing, distribution and hierarchy of these narratives, and the alignments of the storytellers and their audiences. </span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c12 c8 c11 c13\"></span></p><p class=\"c1 c19\"><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\">maps bring three approaches to different digital media: Twitter inthe social media space, the web, and the platform amazon.

How is climate change made into a matter of concern in this space? And how can we study this through the metrics and formats that the platform offers, for instance, which issues travel better in this medium? Which are most often retweeted? And, what hashtags or sources have influence in this space? </span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">We assembled a collection of &nbsp;XX tweets and their metadata from November 2013 to June 2013 on the topic of climate change and global warming. </span><span class=\"c13 c12 c8 c11\">We focused on the four dominant approaches, which we demarcated by</span><span class=\"c8 c11\">&nbsp;querying in the collecting for &ldquo;skeptic&rdquo;, &ldquo;mitigation&rdquo;, &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; and &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; OR &ldquo;violence&rdquo;. The result were four sub-collections. Using the metrics and data extracted from each subcollection we created a profile for each approach and compile them in a poster. This includes per approach the number of tweets and users, top hashtags, mentioned users and domain names, which were and categorized according to the area to which they belong, for example, if the are media organization, scientific or governmental actors. It also looks at the kind of content that circulates in terms of urls and retweets. Overall it provides the means to not only learn about Twitter around climate change, but to compare different subspaces according to the discourse.</span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">inbuilt means of analysis</span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span style=\"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 146.50px; height: 247.92px;\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-09 at 4.10.40 PM.png\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jPszCGZroqHnm6wNTcE0J4Bl5A1qcv4Sx6bWpXBxpqoe-240hx9VGf9vDmq5qVKMhshrwGIr_gUxkBp4N5Ne-ZPQ_Mw8b39AjwCbhccZblkE_8i-ok4z4YrmNZY\" style=\"width: 146.50px; height: 247.92px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);\" title=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><h5 class=\"c5 c9\"><a name=\"h.n05kqq4w6yht\"></a><span>Map 1. Profiles of adaptation, mitigation, skepticism, and conflict in Twitter.</span></h5><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Significantly more tweets are published about adaptation to climate change than about mitigation and its related issues. Tweets related to skepticism and conflict are close in numbers to those published about adaptation, however while adaptation and mitigation share issues, scepticism and conflict are distinct spaces. The former is dominated by actors who are sceptical of climate change scepticism and the later by those bringing attention and drawing scenarios to recent or newsworthy connections between climate and violence, including connections between drought and the Syrian conflict, and speculation about how climate change will bring conflict to places that already struggling with resources shortages. It appears that while denial about climate change is foregrounded, conflict emerges as a new fringe, fighting its way to the mainstream.</span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span style=\"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 140.00px;\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-11 at 10.59.11 AM.png\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/N-8ems95mkoW1pa6WeN6aMi9F1H4jtqArYNR6OVGYiOItnMfIVIUn0f9spSuJ0SjpkBT53zWN0exa1AU60f2oKuqCPAJuqL0ZQY-LYgLXrJeOwOH1c3kqEmRC08\" style=\"width: 624.00px; height: 140.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);\" title=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><h5 class=\"c5 c9\"><a name=\"h.86u21wl7yu35\"></a><span>Map 2. Number of Tweets and users per approach in climate change tweets, zoom-in.</span></h5><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Hashtags work as built-in devices in Twitter for the organization of topics into streams. It is often that the tweets associated with them are analyzed as telling stories about particular events such as conferences, elections or protests, and about people, for example, when their names become hashtags. We are interested in what kind of stories emerge when we look at adaptation, mitigation, skepticism and conflict related hashtags. Profiling of climate change with Twitter, we do not start with a set of predefined issues but let Twitter tell us what issues are emerging around climate change. How does climate change become an issue that can be shared and circulated?</span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Adaptation and mitigation hashtags describe a heightened activity around events, summits and treaties, with the United Nations being protagonist. For example, #COP18 is the hashtag for the United Nations Climate Change Conference which took place in Doha and is present in both sub-collections, as well as #UNFCC for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change present in relation to mitigation, while the 7-th Conference on Community -Based Adaptation to Climate Change was present for adaptation. A noteworthy hashtag is #agriculture, present in both mitigation and adaptation tweets, but with a larger amount of tweets containing it in the adaptation collection. Agriculture, a food related issue, acts a shared concern, creating more attentions and as a successful format for the climate change debate. </span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">the Twitter climate conflict space draws connections between a mixture of controversial </span><span class=\"c8 c11\">issues</span><span class=\"c8 c11\">. On Twitter climate conflict is described the link with particular conflicts, such as Syria. However the links between climate change is extended to the shootings in Sandy Hook and increasingly becoming intertwined with American politics (through hashtags related to Washington legislature, the conservative party and the current president), gun regulation (through the hashtag of the National Rifle Association) and a number of medical conditions, from autism to obesity and ADD. The relation here is not of consequence as with the Syrian conflict, but for example, those that deny climate change are compared to those that denied the potential benefits of harder policy on gun control in the United States, with skepticism and conflict in the climate change discourse becoming yet again entangled.</span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span style=\"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 176.00px;\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-11 at 11.10.48 AM.png\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pOGIbcXtJoytBpVERG8p-dYWscjEUauJgqIjBiUJ4PTZRv7KBMzCjmthRJbbwB_CJtbxTklWukdq2ZHrUEqPEaqj22Xcr2b9x1y1xp6ySkRiMEOGUX0ca4TJm6g\" style=\"width: 624.00px; height: 176.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);\" title=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">Map 3.

In order to address this, top sources, top active users, and top mentioned users are extracted for each of the approaches and further analyzed. </span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Mentioned users are international organizations with </span><span class=\"c12 c8 c11\">CGIAR (Research Program on Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security) </span><span class=\"c8 c11\">both adaptation and mitigation, the same takes place in top user category and hostname with with organizations such as</span><span class=\"c12 c8 c11\">,</span><span class=\"c8 c11\">&nbsp;Mask-Africa Food Security Program and the most shared URL in mitigation subcollection being by the organization Green Registry on food securities and adaptation role in it. It appears that is not a approach that is driving the conversation, but instead food security as an issue is, which can give interesting insights on the focus of climate change.

Having already identified prominent issues and actors in each of the approaches, namely adaptation, mitigation, skepticism and conflict, now the interest i to map them in relation each other.

How can insights about this complex techno-scientific issue be derived from the web&rsquo;s defining features, from hyperlinks, to recommendation systems? </span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c15\"></span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c15\">One way to do so is to consider the web and its hyperlink structure, with websites receiving links and pointing links towards other websites, as indicators for an actor&rsquo;s position, be it central or peripheral, in a web network around an issue. To ascertain this position expert lists of websites on a particular topic can be created and their associations be traced by means of hyperlink analysis. Going a step further, the agenda of an actor, group of actors or of a field of activity can be ascertained by means of querying relevant issues for their resonance in the websites of these actors. Hence we may be able to describe the climate change agenda of the U.N. and of NGOs dedicated to this issue by means of the issues that resonate most in their websites as well as those that are marginalised (maps 3 and 4). </span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c15\"></span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c15\">Another way is to repurpose search engines such as Google and its website rankings for research. As a central entry point to the web, Google&rsquo;s search algorithm takes the number of inlinks that a website receives as an indicator of reputation and orders sources accordingly, thus creating a hierarchy of information on the web. These hierarchies of information do not only reflect search engine logics but also societal dynamics. Following the position that &ldquo;We look at Google results and see society instead of Google&rdquo; (Rogers, Social Research with the Web, p. 1), search engine results and website rankings for particular queries can be used to ascertain how issues are turned into matters of concern online. A more specific position is to maintain that the Web as accessed through search engines presents itself as a &ldquo;a potential collision space for alternative accounts of reality.&rdquo; (Rogers, The End of the Virtual, p. 19). </span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c15\"></span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c15\">How do these medium-specific dynamics play out in the case of climate change? How does the web account for this ongoing debate? In the case of climate change we may enquire into the sources which are privileged and which make it to the top of Google results, be they web search or image search results, as well as their nature and the issues which they carry/bear (maps 1 and 2). We may ask whether these influential sources and the issues which they bear are mainstream or if they are challenging official accounts. Are different accounts of climate change sitting side by side or do web results align with official or mainstream accounts?</span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c15\"></span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c15\">In particular our interest lies in the</span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;extent to which adaptation is organising climate change discourse not only in climate science (IPCC WG2 report 2014, p. 2), but in other spaces as well, as well as </span><span class=\"c15\">whether Google recognises the main responses to climate change: scepticism, mitigation, adaptation and conflict and, the hierarchy of attention which it generates towards these approaches.</span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c15\"></span></p><p class=\"c1 c19\"><span class=\"c2 c13\">To start off, we query the </span><span class=\"c15\">keywords &lsquo;skeptic&rsquo;, &lsquo;mitigation, &lsquo;adaptation&rsquo; and &lsquo;conflict&rsquo; in the top seventeen Google results, as captured in June 2013. We find that the account of climate change organised by the top Google results aligns with official accounts from scientific literature. Similarly to the scientific space where adaptation has become a central area of research, with the volume of literature on this topic more than doubling between 2005 and 2010 (</span><span class=\"c0\">IPCC WG2 report 2014, </span><span class=\"c15\">p. 2), in the climate change web space adaptation is the most resonant issue, taking over from mitigation and scepticism in terms of resonance. The second most resonant issue, conflict, gestures towards another feature of the web, the web as an anticipatory medium (Rogers, Viagra Files), as recent years have seen </span><span class=\"c2 c13\">conflict has emerged as a fourth discourse around climate change, where violent reactions could follow climate instability and a failure to mitigate and to adapt [cite some media articles and academic papers]. </span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c15\"></span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c15\">A second concern are the visual aesthetics of climate change which Google Image Search organise. We thus ask: </span><span class=\"c2\">What does web-based imagery of climate change add to the discourse around this topic? What matters of concern emerge from climate change imagery as accessed through Google Images? </span><span class=\"c2 c13\">What visuals illustrate the climate change debate? The top 1000 Google Images provides us with a picture of climate change dominated by landscape imagery, in particular disasters and land and sea images (floating icebergs, dry lands), and very little human presence. Climate science is recognised in the climate change image space through graphs and maps, as well as human actors in this ongoing debate, particularly activists and decision-makers.</span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c16 c15\"></span></p><p class=\"c18 c1\"><span class=\"c2 c13\">Next we look at where adaptation is situated on the agendas of two important institutional actors in the climate change space, climate NGOs and the UN, and how these approaches are turned into matters of concern. We query the four dominant issues, scepticism, mitigation, adaptation and conflict, in the websites of UN</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c2 c13\">agencies that work on climate change, and identify, similarly to the top Google results, that </span><span class=\"c2\">conflict is recognised as prominent issue</span><span class=\"c2 c13\">, </span><span class=\"c2\">followed closely by adaptation, and mitigation and scepticism as a distant third and fourth. </span></p><p class=\"c18 c1 c10\"><span class=\"c15\"></span></p><p class=\"c1 c18\"><span class=\"c15\">Whereas conflict configured as a refugee care and development issue tops the UN&rsquo;s climate change agenda, for climate NGOs &lsquo;food&rsquo; emerges as a priority issue. In the case of climate NGOs we do not start with a list of predefined issues to determine their resonance, but read the issues prioritised by a network of 74 NGOs from dedicated sections on their websites. This analysis shows us that NGOs configure climate change as an environmental issue with concerns such as &lsquo;water&rsquo;, &lsquo;oil&rsquo;, &lsquo;agriculture&rsquo;, and &lsquo;conservation&rsquo; resonating most, and as a humanitarian issue, wiht concerns such as &lsquo;food&rsquo;, &lsquo;community&rsquo;, &lsquo;women&rsquo;, &lsquo;children&rsquo;, &lsquo;poverty&rsquo;, &lsquo;Israel&rsquo;, &lsquo;right&rsquo;, &lsquo;education&rsquo; and &lsquo;health&rsquo; being most prominent.</span></p><p class=\"c18 c1 c10\"><span class=\"c15\"></span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">[Section III]</span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c22 c8 c11\">Reading the state of climate change trough Amazon.com</span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c22 c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Amazon.com is the world&#39;s largest online retailer and </span><span class=\"c12 c8 c11\">one of the leading product search engines, </span><span class=\"c8 c11\">whith its own built-in analytics and pre-order data. Books are ranked based on the selling rank, amongst other metrics, also Amazon&rsquo;s descriptions (the entry or selling point when choosing literature) As climate change leaves the specialized space of scientific literature, moves beyond summits and reports and becomes even more entangled with commercial spaces, here we add the question: what are people reading when they read about climate change? What issues make into books, sell better and potentially make into people&rsquo;s bookshelves? </span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Two sets of maps are developed, one focusing on best-selling titles associated with climate change adaptation, mitigation, skepticism and conflict. </span><span class=\"c12 c8 c11\">Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website, and this may lead to an increase in sale </span><span class=\"c8 c11\">u</span><span class=\"c8 c11\">ser purchase</span><span class=\"c8 c11\">s. A second set, takes the genre of science fiction (cli-fi) &nbsp;in which questions about our climatic futures and capacity to adapt to them is addressed as it object and uses Amazon&rsquo;s descriptions as a way of studying them.</span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Amazon is approached first as a collection-making device. Similarly to headline analysis and scientometrics, we analyze books through their titles, and groups of titles through their components (words) and search for relations amongst them (co-word analysis). As titles synthesize the main ideas and orientation of a text, and signal the importance of the particular topics, they are an appropriate object to study. The inclusion of the Best Sellers Rank on the analysis adds, to what would otherwise be an analysis of media production, the element of consumption, and locates the formating of a debate as taking place in within a &lsquo;marketplace for issues&rsquo; where some are more popular and therefore rank higher.</span><span class=\"c22 c8 c11\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c8 c11\">Being ranked as a best-selling product is used as metric or indication of the uptake and positive resonance of a topic with a specific public</span></p><p class=\"c6 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">The research aims to answers which sub-issues have become more prominent in the information space organized around each of these approaches? and are there overlaps? Are there any counter-works (for instance, a book skeptical of mitigation) amongst the most popular titles? And, is the collection of best-selling books associated with climate change diverse or homogeneous? And what is left outside?</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">How are adaptation, mitigation, skepticism and conflict</span><span class=\"c22 c8 c11\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c8 c11\">formatted and issuefied in mainstream literature about climate change? Tittles and metadata of best-selling books associated with each of the approaches are captured from Amazon.com and visualized a co-word network graphs. The keywords that outstand in these networks are referred to as best-selling issues and are read as an indication of the aspects of the climate change debate that reach and resonate more in mainstream literature. A comparative analysis reveals how different aspects, places and vocabularies about climate change do well in the market and appeal to readers.</span></p><p class=\"c1 c10\"><span class=\"c8 c11\"></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span style=\"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 429.40px; height: 303.16px;\"><img alt=\"climate_change_adaptation.jpg\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iEymYgligUXthuoZ_SLrqpVa3-bMtmUn3w_prumG2VV-fwQlD3RGL7EDTKqRwvO9PCgokQb4hXEi3MrT1nom0ecVlJB3dqcwQd3E9DAJtVFWdq7b3CLp9kVqg18\" style=\"width: 429.40px; height: 303.16px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);\" title=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">Map X.
