It is also one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change for several reasons:</p><ul ><li >Its biophysical resources, particularly water, are highly sensitive to climate variability and change </li><li >Due to Bangladesh&rsquo;s location it is at risk of cyclones, drought, earthquakes, tornados and flooding. </li><li >It has a very low lying geography, with half of the country at or below 6 metres above sea level. &nbsp;A 1 metre sea level rise would result in 10% of the land flooding</li><li >Exacerbating its environmental risks, the human geography makes adaptation more of a challenge. Bangladesh has a high population density. It is the 4th largest population in the world, and the 11th most densely populated. It is by far the largest densely populated country in the world, the 10 entire populations of the top 10 most populated countries would fit into Bangladesh&rsquo;s largest city Dhaka.</li><li >Bangladesh is also a very poor country with 26% of the population living on less than $2 per day, despite growth rates of 4-6% in recent years.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt2\" >[2]</a></sup></li></ul><p ></p><p >The combination of these factors means that Bangladesh is uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and in need of international support to adapt. Figure 1 below shows the different risks present within this one country.</p><p ><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qDfGqVj_uMwBP87nS8ELrYz_71xjxAQQQz4XYDE3LPfbTW1JsAMVUTOp_OF4_fgWY5Nv66UKl0lkqStn7XgsHIIaw267mlKNj2P_Hsqv1jDhH-GE5DDPrF5-w4U\"  title=\"\"></p><h5 ><a ></a>Figure 1: Climate Vulnerability in Bangladesh</h5><p ></p><p >The large risks to Bangladesh has helped the government to attract significant international adaptation finance. Since 2003 it has attracted pledges of over $1bn. Unfortunately most of these pledges have not actually materialised in Bangladesh yet - much of the funding is still to be disbursed.</p><p ></p><p >Figure 2 shows how the international funding promised to Bangladesh has massively increased starting from 2010. This increase derives from the pledges of the Japan&rsquo;s Fast Start Finance Fund, of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience and of the UK International Climate Fund. Together these three funds have offered about 450 millions dollars to Bangladesh.</p><p >However, the maps also shows that only a tiny part of these pledges (little more than 1 million) has been disbursed yet.</p><p >Other funds (namely the LDC Fund, the Global Climate Alliance Fund and the GEF Trust Fund) have been less generous in their pledges, but have already disbursed larger sums of money (almost 40 millions dollars).</p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2ZJyDuUJL_CJgRmHi8qgEpppmgxy355_hfzcy5kknQH-2qsjeABLIYjRRz6tt1UvrkSsHzf-pd2vnZwXywvHjurP08axSmgH6wTBOuVgd6fKfs-4m3ttJiQdtvY\"  title=\"\"></p><h5 ><a ></a>Figure 2. Streamgraph of the pledged and disbursed for adaptation in Bangladesh.</h5><p ></p><p >The slow disbursement of international funding has forced the Bangladeshi government to take a much more active role in helping its citizens adapt to climate change. A government review in 2014 found that three quarters of adaptation funding in Bangladesh came from the government, it currently spends $1bn a year on adaptation - around 6 or 7% of its annual budget.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt3\" >[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;This funding is channeled through the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF). The maps below are based on publicly available data from those and data from Climate Funds Update on multilateral and bilateral international funding.</p><p ></p><p >The Bangladeshi government&rsquo;s commitment to adapting to climate change is clear from the database of adaptation projects we created for this project. The Japan Fast Start Finance programme provides a large amount of funding for a small number of projects - it is unclear how much of this has actually been disbursed in the country. In contrast the Bangladesh government (through the BCCTF) has spent only a little less on a much larger number of projects. The BCCRF which is locally administered but disburses international funds again focuses on a smaller number of larger projects. The priorities of international and national actors are different. </p><p ></p><p >The position of the projects financed by the Japan&#39;s Fast Start Finance is also remarkable with 4 projects (Bheramara Combined Cycle Power Plant Development, Rural electrification, Improvement of Capabilities to Cope with Natural Disasters, Khulna Water Supply) expected to receive almost 285 millions of dollars.</p><p ><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DJyC2g__EqSsKNUNbTBc9RHjNc2ukMOxuc9ZLJdJ5xSJJI0JEn0DydpQ-CocAO5fczfhF-g45Zj6D4rXnxsDYfs1lz6ZdUtxDAnzK4euc_yNEUBQW6oAhrtf9so\"  title=\"\"></p><h5 ><a ></a>Figure 3.&nbsp;Scatterplot of number of projects and amount of funding from different funders</h5><p ></p>",

Treemap of adaptation project funding in Bangladesh by Division</h5><p ></p><p >The treemap above shows how much funding has been pledged to each of Bangladesh&rsquo;s seven regions. The district of Khulna appears to be the best financed (by far). Looking at the data, we discover that this preeminence derives from one single but massive water supply project that the Japan&#39;s Fast Start Finance has promised to fund in the region with more than 135 millions of euros (about the 15% of all the funding pledged so far for climate adaptation Bangladesh).</p><p ></p><p >Unsurprisingly Sylhet, the top right of Figure 1 receives the least amount of adaptation funding. Figure 1 suggests Sylhet is only at risk of flooding - relative safety in comparison to other parts of Bangladesh. In contrast Dhaka is relatively underfunded. This region is the highly and densely populated, containing the capital, Dhaka. It was devastated by the Bhola cyclone in the 1970s (with an estimated 500,000 casualties). Yet, according to our data, only only 5 projects are expected to be organized in the district of Dhaka for a total of less than 10 millions euros.</p><p ></p><p >The uneven distribution of adaptation actions in Bangladesh both in terms of the funds invested and the number of projects is clear. Considering the number of projects organized in different regions, Chittagong appears to be the most active district of the country. The national Government through the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund supports &nbsp;21 projects in this region with amounts varying from 130.000 to more than 3 millions of dollars In contrast, again Sylhet to the north has the least projects with seven.</p><p ><img alt=\"Treemap_02 DIVISIONS.png\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Dps6pzTtziw-9xouw2SH69BLa5dyb5Bnc4xbsMWYCl9so6ELabpnSw3UKulr_W27sd3cdf6KfAfcbruV67BUvnvgAstAPY3MOFTWkdNMOSCRJ-fFq3qnXoXGn_k\"  title=\"\"></p><h5 ><a ></a>Figure 5.
