For example, t</span><span>he Netherlands concentrates its aid on few countries and few areas.

The EU institutions seem to have made it theirs as well.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>Another anomaly, on the other end of the spectrum, is Spain. They provide, overall, less adaptation aid than the Netherlands, yet donate their aid to the highest number of recipient countries among all OECD donor. Further they are the 6th highest country in terms of the number of adaptation areas they fund.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>An intermediate choice seems to be that of Korea, whose total amount of aid is in the same range as the Netherlands and Spain. The number of recipient countries of the Netherlands and Korea are similar so they are aligned vertically; the number of areas of Korea and Spain are similar, so they are aligned horizontally. Korea seems to favor a low number of recipient countries, while being more liberal as concerns the areas it wants to foster.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>Irrespective of the amount of money they commit to, two groups of countries stand out : Germany, Canada and Japan and the United Kingdom on one side; Australia, Italy, Switzerland, France and Norway on the other side.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>The US is one of the top contributors to Fast Start Finance (Nakhooda </span><span class=\"c3\">et al.</span><span>&nbsp;2013). Surprisingly, they report insignificant adaptation aid to the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC). This brings up a potential bias in the use we make ot the data: the Official Development Assistance (ODA) reported to OECD DAC is coded by the donor countries themselves through the Rio marker &laquo; adaptation &raquo; implemented in 2010. Many researchers (</span><span>like Michaelowa &amp; Michaelowa 2011) </span><span>have emphasized the political nature of that coding, whose parameters include the preferences and choices of donor countries and their interests with regard to their investment portfolios : whether they need to demonstrate the additional nature of adaptation funding, justify that their commitments have been met, or look for easily verifiable adaptation outcomes. They might have interest in underreporting adaptation aid, as the example of the US shows.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p>",

It can be assumed than Japan &ldquo;overcodes&rdquo; adaptation aid, but it could alternatively be speculated that this is the Japanese funding style, and the Japanese version of climate change adaptation - coping with natural disasters - as much as other styles co-exist. For example, the German version of adaptation would be solving the future of agriculture (agricultural land resources, rural development, forestry development, agricultural research) the Canadian version, searching new energy sources (wind power, solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass&hellip;), or the UK version, protecting biodiversity.</span></p>",

One of the biases of this network visualization is that the smaller contributors have a tendancy to be rejected on the margins of the map. This is the case of the United States, as they report few adaptation aid to OECD DAC, which are located far away from the central cluster. Its closest receiving grouping are the League of Arab States and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its closest donor neighbour, Greece.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>Yet, some big contributors are also located outside the central cluster : Ireland and the Uk (which are close to each other), Canada and Germany. Germany is much closer to the G77 and the African group, than to the LDC.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>Another non-conformist choice is that of Luxemburg, closest to the Central Asia, Caucasus and Moldova&rdquo; group.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>This network visualization opens the possibility to envisage alternative yet improbable political alliances of countries close to each other on the map : Korea, Spain and Finalnd ; New Zealand, Belgium and the Alliance of Small Island States, in order to modify the geopolitics of adaptation within the UNFCCC arena.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span></span></p>",
