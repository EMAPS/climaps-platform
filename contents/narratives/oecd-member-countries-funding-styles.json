Date: January 6, 2014.</h5><p ></p><p >Figure 1&nbsp;shows that the different donor countries have very different patterns in terms of how concentrated their adaptation aid is on a few or multiple different adaptation areas and recipient countries, which appears to be loosely correlated with the overall amount of money they donate; countries which commit less adaptation aid tend to give to a fewer number of recipients countries as well as adaptation areas (e.g. Portugal, Czech Republic, Greece), whilst larger funders such as the United Kingdom and Japan provide to a reasonably large number of both adaptation areas and countries. </p><p ></p><p >However, there are exceptions to this common-sense rule. For example, the Netherlands concentrates its aid on few countries and few areas. This appears to be as a result of a political decision made by the Dutch government in order <a  href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.government.nl%2Fissues%2Fdevelopment-cooperation&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH35IP1MGvF-8Dbd0HvUTiqNT3FUg\">to render its aid more efficient.</a>&nbsp;Chose carefully whom you give to, and for what purpose: this could be the motto of this distribution pattern. The EU institutions seem to have made it theirs as well.</p><p ></p><p >Another anomaly, on the other end of the spectrum, is Spain. They provide, overall, less adaptation aid than the Netherlands, yet donate their aid to the highest number of recipient countries among all OECD donor. Further they are the 6th highest country in terms of the number of adaptation areas they fund.</p><p ></p><p >An intermediate choice seems to be that of Korea, whose total amount of aid is in the same range as the Netherlands and Spain. The number of recipient countries of the Netherlands and Korea are similar so they are aligned vertically; the number of areas of Korea and Spain are similar, so they are aligned horizontally. Korea seems to favor a low number of recipient countries, while being more liberal as concerns the areas it wants to foster.</p><p ></p><p >Irrespective of the amount of money they commit to, two groups of countries stand out : Germany, Canada and Japan and the United Kingdom on one side; Australia, Italy, Switzerland, France and Norway on the other side.</p><p ></p><p >The US is one of the top contributors to Fast Start Finance (Nakhooda et al.&nbsp;2013). Surprisingly, they report insignificant adaptation aid to the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC). This brings up a potential bias in the use we make ot the data: the Official Development Assistance (ODA) reported to OECD DAC is coded by the donor countries themselves through the Rio marker &laquo; adaptation &raquo; implemented in 2010. Many researchers (like Michaelowa &amp; Michaelowa 2011) have emphasized the political nature of that coding, whose parameters include the preferences and choices of donor countries and their interests with regard to their investment portfolios : whether they need to demonstrate the additional nature of adaptation funding, justify that their commitments have been met, or look for easily verifiable adaptation outcomes. They might have interest in underreporting adaptation aid, as the example of the US shows.</p><p ></p>",

Looking at the same countries&rsquo; top specific areas (Figure 3), France seems very committed to the area &ldquo;Water supply and sanitation - large systems&rdquo; whereas United Kingdom favors &ldquo;biodiversity&rdquo;, of which it is the main contributor. It is interesting to note that biodiversity seems an important adaptation concern within the UK. It has a longstanding history: UK was the first country to publish a national biodiversity action plan in 1994, two years after they signed the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p><p ></p><p >Thus there seems to be different preference patterns among donor countries.

Does Japan count wrongly its humanitarian aid in Fast Track Finance &nbsp;? It can be assumed than Japan &ldquo;overcodes&rdquo; adaptation aid, but it could alternatively be speculated that this is the Japanese funding style, and the Japanese version of climate change adaptation - coping with natural disasters - as much as other styles co-exist. For example, the German version of adaptation would be solving the future of agriculture (agricultural land resources, rural development, forestry development, agricultural research) the Canadian version, searching new energy sources (wind power, solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass&hellip;), or the UK version, protecting biodiversity.</p>",

It also gives greater flexibility to projects and ideas not as easily negotiated through the multilateral channels.&rdquo; (Jones et al&nbsp;2012).

Canada seems to have a lot of non-vulnerable recipient countries, appearing in green on Figure 6.
