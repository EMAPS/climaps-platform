  "introduction": "The mother of all issues in the adaptation controversy is arguably about money: who should receive it, and why? At the end of the day most discussions are about the amount of funds that a certain country or group of countries are willing to pledge, which countries or group of countries they are willing to pledge it for, and the justifications given in defence of these choices. This is especially pertinent on the international level, where the negotiations on climate change have moved from mitigation, an issue that is necessarily international (since no country can solve it alone), to also include adaptation. Here it becomes necessary to justify which countries should receive aid and why. A much debated method for doing so is the assessment vulnerability to climate change. Here imperatives of adaptation, development and other related policy arenas overlap in different ways and often less transparent ways. ",

      "html": "<p >Until the early 2000s adaptation was largely seen as a diversion from the ultimate objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Godard, 2010). As a consequence, it was disregarded in the international negotiations on climate change. However, because of growing doubts about the efficacy of mitigation efforts and increasing evidence for the unavoidability of climate change impacts (IPPC 2001) adaptation has since risen to the top of the international policy and research agendas. There is even talk of an &ldquo;adaptation turn&rdquo; in the UNFCCC negotiations, in the IPPC process, and in national climate strategies. At the international level of negotiations, adaptation became one of the four pillars of the Bali Action Plan in the 2007 Conference of the Parties (COP). In a similar manner the fourth and fifth IPCC (2007, 2013-2014) display an increased attention to adaptation. In sum, adaptation is now being integrated at all levels of climate politics &ndash; not just in international negotiations and expertise but also at the individual country level, from national to sub-national to municipal jurisdictions, in both developing and developed countries.</p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oT8cLG8LbYdLHJxklVaUlxnGX34xgQ5rCwu4XxLg9phBze7IQoTyYdVDtmE874KN3CV6SwJTH1D-NJhytWMAGitB5T30gbFf3XRExex54z0_wOUYdxgjh_4KioQ\"  title=\"\"></p><h5 ><a ></a>Figure 1: The rise of adaptation.

Against very narrow framings of the concept some actors have emphasized the importance of placing adaptation to climate change within a broader social, economic and environmental conception of vulnerability. Others consider adaptation as a natural extension of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), which places it within a long established community of practice (Mercer, 2010). And still others see adaptation as a path toward the making of a more resilient society, which involves less emphasis on the structural causes of vulnerability, and more attention to investment practices that produce and enhance resilience, and ultimately to good governance (Adger and Brown, 2009; Adger et al., 2003). Moreover, the concept of adaptation tend to be framed differently in different development contexts (Huq and Reid, 2004). </p><p ></p><p >[Link to narrative 4] </p>",

Since the 1990s there have been quite a few projects that attempted to develop indices that claim to measure vulnerability to social and/or environmental change (Barnett, Lambert and Fry 2008). Such indices typically combine multiple indicators of a variable into a single measure, thus ordering a set of entities with respect to quantitative attributes or traits. As such, they are integral to many contexts that require systematic approaches to decision making processes, especially those that concern the management or governance of risk (cf. Renn and Graham 2004; Klinke and Renn 2005; Beck [2007] 2009). However, according to Barnett, Lambert, and Fry, there have been so many attempts that it has &ldquo;[lead] the National Research Council (2000) to conclude that there is no consensus on their appropriateness, theoretical and scientific basis, and appropriate level of specificity or aggregation&rdquo; (2008:106). Hinkel (2011) presents an analysis of six diverse types of problems that vulnerability indicators are meant to address according to his review of the literature: &ldquo;(i) identification of mitigation targets; (ii) identification of vulnerable people, communities, regions, etc.; (iii) raising awareness; (iv) allocation of adaptation funds; (v) monitoring of adaptation policy; and (vi) conducting scientific research.&rdquo; (198). Based on this, he finds that only the second type of problem can be addressed by vulnerability indicators, but only at small and local scales, causing him to question the concept of vulnerability itself and the applied methodologies (ibid.).</p><p ></p><p >One pragmatic way of exploring these difficulties is to triangulate some of the most commonly used vulnerability indices to see how they agree or disagree in their assessment of different countries.

Even more interesting is the fact that quite a few countries (25) are simultaneously assessed to be most vulnerable and least vulnerable according to different indices. Considering these difficulties, it is perhaps not surprising that the assessment of climate change vulnerability by means of indicators continues to divide both policy and academic communities alike (Hinkel 2011, 198). </p>",

If adapting means addressing vulnerabilities, then how can we distinguish between the importance of climatic stimuli and socio-economic and environmental sensitivities defining the impacts of climate change? In what way is adapting to climate change impacts different from development actions that address some of the most important factors of vulnerability: poverty and lack of governance capacity.

But what the differences in alignment between the LDC fund and the three climate specific vulnerability indices also shows is the different approaches to the assessment of vulnerability to climate change. Adaptive capacity is one of the areas where the overlap between adaptation and development imperatives are strongest. More developed countries tend to have higher adaptive capacity, and so it can be argued that being least developed is in itself to be vulnerable to climate change. Wheres Germanwatch&rsquo;s Climate Risk Index, wich correlates negatively with the priorities of the LDC fund, does include socio-economic costs, it does not include forward looking paramters. It is in other words based on a meassurement of who suffers from natural disasters, and not on who will have more or less adaptive capacity in the future. It seems that this approach to vulnerability assessment overlap significantly less with development imperatives than the approaches adopted in indices like the GAIN or the CVI.</p><p ></p>",

The German Competence Centre on Climate Impacts and Adaptation (KomPass) has set itself the task to promote climate change adaptation.

Apart from a study carried out for the former Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS 2010, pp. 27-71) with a focus on more planning related questions the only other overall study was the vulnerability assessment carried out for the former Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (Zebisch et al. 2005). To answer the question about the regional vulnerability to climate change in Germany it was decided to use the results from Zebisch et al. because a new vulnerability assessment for Germany will not be published before 2015 (Greiving et al. 2014; see also <a  href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnetzwerk-vulnerabilitaet.de&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAW-2eAVcogrU6mmoy2OTHkWosBQ\">&ldquo;Netzwerk Vulnerabilit&auml;t&rdquo;</a>).

Moreover, vulnerability indices can be politically expropriated in many ways, measuring vulnerability levels according to the administrative divisions can create tensions among the regions. Thus, vulnerability was measured on a map of natural areas (bio-geographical regions) with the Upper Rhine Rift and the North-East German Lowland and South-Eastern Basin and Hills to be regarded as the most vulnerable natural areas in Germany (see figure 1).</p>",

In the case of this dataset, which is consisted of 291 projects, it was possible to operationalise the research manually, however if the catalogue was concerned with a more international, and thus bigger dataset, then this factor can be a big obstacle.</p><p ></p><p >One of the factors that this research proved to be really crucial in order to substantiate results was the funding data of the projects. Even though funding data can provide much richer perspective on the research, the dataset unfortunately did not include this information and the retrivement of such data was difficult. During the data sprint, it was only possible to find funding information for &#8532; of the needed projects. The enrichment of the dataset with such information will improve future researches by allowing more correlations to emerge. Funding data can lead to answers to such questions as which projects are considered to be worthy of funding and more importantly if there are any power relations among the actors. This kind of expansion of this research will work in favour of transparency in the works of KomPass and the German climate change adaptation process in general.</p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p>",

In turn, of course, the aim of building indices to influence the public debate is ultimately also a way to influence decision making, but none of the indices that we have looked at here claim to be the recipe for how to prioritise adaptation funding.
