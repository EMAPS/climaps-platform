There is a need to identify those places that are most vulnerable to extreme weather events and distribute the available resources for their aid. At the same time, the effectiveness of practices that aim to mitigate the effects of global warming by managing carbon emission are questioned, predictions of violent uprisings exacerbated by rising temperatures populate headlines and depict bleak futures. Scientists and activists on the fringe deny man&rsquo;s role in affecting the climate and suspect of the motivations behind environmental policies. What is the state of the climate change debate, and where is adaptation located with respect to discourses of mitigation, skepticism and conflict? What actors are prioritizing adaptation over other approaches? And, what aspects or sub-issues from adaptation resonate the most? </p><p ></p><p >The fifth assessment report published in March 2014 by the IPCC noted a general increase in scientific literature on the topic of climate change, with the volume of publications doubling in less than five years, and with&nbsp;adaptation becoming a central area of research (IPCC Report, 2014, p. 2-3). We build on these findings and bring these questions to digital media: is adaptation also a leading issue outside academic publishing? The results are three sets of maps organized around mainstream digital media. On Twitter, a social media service, we identify which hashtags, users and sources dominate the global warming space, and with this information we produce profiles (in the format of a poster) for adaptation, mitigation, skepticism and conflict.&nbsp;Through search engines we look at what people find in Google when searching for climate change, and what NGOs working with the issue prioritize on their websites.&nbsp;Thirdly, in the e-commerce platform amazon.com, we want to know what books (and issues) about climate change sell well and what future scenarios are depicted in climate fiction (cli-fi), where adaption to climate change no longer seems a plan for the future, but an everyday practice of survival. </p><p ></p><p >The findings confirm adaptation as a leading discourse in digital media, with more tweets and websites addressing the issue, and with food security, an adaption issue, leading the conversation across media and capturing the attention of different publics. The analysis also reveals specific characterizations of climate change in the different media types. For instance, Twitter is the space where human and animal victims capture people&rsquo;s attention and where NGOs most effectively distribute their message, with hashtags and sources representing their voices. A discourse of conflict emerges in news sites and new terminologies appear in literature, such as &lsquo;cold wars&rsquo; to describe potential conflicts over the melting Arctic. Skepticism is on the fringe and best selling titles and hashtags, surprisingly, are for those skeptical of skepticism. </p><p ></p>",

Users follow other people as well as news sites, NGOs, government offices and events through the practice of creating event-related hashtags. The collective work that takes place on Twitter plays a role in determining how certain topics gain high levels of popularity, for example, a successful campaign or a catchy hashtag can place an issue in the news and organize millions of people around it, even if momentarily. Consequently, the number of retweets, followers and updates have become metrics used to gain insight into how different actors engage with issues and which aspects of a topic are more successful and travel better, for example by being retweeted. </p><p ></p><p >How is climate change made into a matter of concern to be shared and circulated on Twitter? Are the users and sources that come together around adaptation different from those that do so for mitigation, skepticism and conflict? Which are most often retweeted? And, what hashtags and sources have influence in this space? &nbsp;</p><p ></p><p >A collection of &nbsp;XX tweets and their metadata, captured from November 2013 to June 2013 on the topic of climate change and global warming, is&nbsp;queried for the terms &ldquo;skeptic&rdquo;, &ldquo;mitigation&rdquo;, &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; and &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; OR &ldquo;violence&rdquo;, resulting in four subcollections. The data is used to build a profile for each of the approaches, that includes the number of tweets, the most mentioned users, hashtags, and domain names, most shared urls and retweets. The posters provides a visual summary of how climate change is discussed in Twitter and how users of the platform are engaging with it. From a methodological perspective, its an alternative way of identifying relevant issues, as we do not start with a set of predefined list but instead let Twitter &lsquo;tell&rsquo; us what issues are emerging around climate change.</p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-09 at 4.10.40 PM.png\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jPszCGZroqHnm6wNTcE0J4Bl5A1qcv4Sx6bWpXBxpqoe-240hx9VGf9vDmq5qVKMhshrwGIr_gUxkBp4N5Ne-ZPQ_Mw8b39AjwCbhccZblkE_8i-ok4z4YrmNZY\"  title=\"\"></p><p ></p><h5 ><a ></a>Map 1. Profiles of adaptation, mitigation, skepticism, and conflict in Twitter.</h5><p ></p><p >Significantly more tweets are published that address adaptation to climate change than mitigation and its related issues. Tweets related to skepticism and conflict are close in numbers to those published about adaptation, however while adaptation and mitigation share issues, scepticism and conflict are distinct spaces. The former is dominated by actors who are sceptical of climate change scepticism and the latter by those drawing attention to newsworthy connections between climate and violence, including links between extreme drought and the Syrian conflict, and speculations about how climate change will bring conflict to places that are already struggling with resources shortages. It appears that while denial about climate change is foregrounded and the vocabulary adopted by those that trust in climate science, conflict emerges as a new type of issue, making its way to the mainstream.</p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-11 at 10.59.11 AM.png\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/N-8ems95mkoW1pa6WeN6aMi9F1H4jtqArYNR6OVGYiOItnMfIVIUn0f9spSuJ0SjpkBT53zWN0exa1AU60f2oKuqCPAJuqL0ZQY-LYgLXrJeOwOH1c3kqEmRC08\"  title=\"\"></p><p ></p><h5 ><a ></a>Map 2. Number of Tweets and users per approach in climate change tweets, zoom-in.</h5><p ></p><p >Hashtags work as built-in devices for the organization of topics into streams on Twitter. It is often that the tweets associated with specific hashtags are analyzed as telling stories about particular events such as conferences, elections or protests, and about people, for example, when someone&rsquo;s name becomes a hashtag. Here we are interested in what kind of stories emerge when we look at adaptation, mitigation, skepticism and conflict related hashtags. </p><p ></p><p >From the outset it appears that adaptation and mitigation hashtags have a heightened activity around climate change around events, summits and treaties, with the United Nations as protagonist. For example, #COP18 is the hashtag for the United Nations Climate Change Conference which took place in Doha and is present in both adaptation and mitigation tweets, as well as #UNFCC for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change present in relation to mitigation. A noteworthy hashtag is #agriculture, a food related issue, also present in both mitigation and adaptation tweets, but with a larger prevalence in the adaptation collection. </p><p ></p><p >Slightly different, the climate conflict space draws connections between a mixture of controversial issues. Direct links between extreme weather and particular conflicts, such as Syrian ones, are made. However, the association between climate change and conflict is extended to the shootings in Sandy Hook and increasingly becoming intertwined with American politics (through hashtags related to Washington legislature, the conservative party and the current president), gun regulation (through the hashtag of the National Rifle Association) and a number of medical conditions, from autism to obesity and ADD. The relation here is not of consequence as with the Syrian conflict, but instead those that deny climate change are compared by users to those that deny the potential benefits that a harder policy on gun control in the United States might bring. </p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-11 at 11.10.48 AM.png\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pOGIbcXtJoytBpVERG8p-dYWscjEUauJgqIjBiUJ4PTZRv7KBMzCjmthRJbbwB_CJtbxTklWukdq2ZHrUEqPEaqj22Xcr2b9x1y1xp6ySkRiMEOGUX0ca4TJm6g\"  title=\"\"></p><h5 ><a ></a>Map 3. Top 10 hashtags per approach in climate change tweets, zoom-in.</h5><p ></p><p >When studying issues and controversies often questions move beyond the substance (what issues are mentioned?), to inquire into who are the speakers, subjects and authorities in a specific debate. In order to address this with respect to climate change, top sources, top active users, and top mentioned users are extracted for each of the approaches and further analyzed. &nbsp;For climate change adaptation and mitigation the most mentioned users are international organizations that work with the issue of food security. For example, the CGIAR (Research Program on Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security) ranks high in both. Similarly, top users and hostnames are organizations, for adaptation is the Mask-Africa Food Security Program. When looking at the type of content that circulates, and the most shared URL in mitigation subcollection is from the organization Green Registry, on the topic of food securities and adaptation policy&rsquo;s role in it. In terms of top users, or those users than in these sub-collection tweeted the most, for adaptation again NGOs Mask-Africa ranks higher as well as other dedicated accounts. In mitigation top users are more diverse and include companies, academics and international organizations. </p><p ></p><p >For climate change skepticism top users are websites skeptical of climate change skepticism and most shared content is in support of evidence of man made climate change. Differently from the other approaches, news media ranks high and it has clear protagonists, for instance, Al Gore as well as journalists and entrepreneurs infamous for their skepticism. Similarly, conflict is associated with new media and public figures, for instance radio show hosts (@hermancain), but also organizations with a humanitarian focus such as Oxfam and Greenpeace.</p><p ></p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-11 at 11.16.00 AM.png\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6lcItH2D2yo4CvSEtoFmFjY2_OJMM0_RG_2JEpKs_YoGSqGVLK7EmIu6daHGsu1hNElaY6mDPzXX3bFiBybOWUg9sBjom2wiiG_5i4TmmnsCwpgHTJfhr0djuDw\"  title=\"\"></p><p ></p><h5 ><a ></a>Map 4.&nbsp;Top 10 mentioned users, active users and host names per approach in climate change tweets, zoom-in.</h5><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-11 at 11.29.32 AM.png\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ta_8hajXqr-jTisdUKrcfIBX45S17XOkL1hhZFqy4Vn-PSLY1jGwtRHngx3x0e7KDwTd9ospXvdPQMSHZTsNSGea6TYVDaMPA0yahXMixcOHQFKwgDMehA6N1_A\"  title=\"\"></p><h5 ><a ></a>Map 5.&nbsp;Top URl and retweet per approach in climate change tweets, zoom-in.</h5><p ></p><p >Having zoomed into the most prominent issues and actors in adaptation, mitigation, skepticism and conflict tweets, now the analysis takes a more panoptic approach. Here a co-hashtag analysis is performed around the broader terms of climate change and global warming, where hashtags often included in the same tweets are visualized as spatially close in the graph and forming thematic clusters. A close reading of the included Tweets reveals an ecology of sub-issues illustrating the current state of climate action and adaptation. Particularly interesting are the number of climate vulnerability and victims themed clusters that can be identified within the climate change issue space on Twitter, ranging from vulnerable animals and habitats, to victims of extreme weather events. Some other clusters seem to focus on geographical regions such as Australia, Canada and the US, albeit mainly in terms of climate change or global warming being an important topic on their political agenda. Clusters formed by hashtags related to official sources (UN and IPCC), climate activism and everyday weather remarks additionally show that most conversations on Twitter emerge around particular (current) events and other real time experiences. The network further displays clusters focused on the three different stages of climate change (skepticism, adaptation and mitigation), and the gradually emerging perspective that climate change vulnerability and conflict might be connected (Arab Spring).</p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-10 at 11.58.21 AM.png\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4L9paRk0gro-nDKT-_By5yZE6-untBE2fGtn4ICNjifWVxTF5UIXd3pg89_6hhy-cj_zEQjDGwuEEDxS4_ssNeI2t4dov-xqupqHxgNh-OcmCau4cELqXmD1LsY\"  title=\"\"></p><p ></p><h5 ><a ></a>Map&nbsp;6 Co-hashtag map in climate Twitter collection.</h5><p ></p><p ></p>",

      "html": "<p ></p><p >This set of maps takes the web and its ordering devices as a site for studying public debates about climate change. How can insights about this complex techno-scientific issue be derived from the web&rsquo;s defining features, from hyperlinks, to recommendation systems? </p><p ></p><p >One way to do so is to consider the web and its hyperlink structure, with websites receiving links and pointing links towards other websites, as indicators for an actor&rsquo;s position, be it central or peripheral, in a web network around an issue. To ascertain this position, expert lists of websites on a particular topic can be created and their associations be traced by means of hyperlink analysis. Going a step further, the agenda of an actor, group of actors or of a field of activity can be ascertained by means of querying relevant issues for their resonance in the websites of these actors. Hence we may be able to describe the climate change agenda of the U.N. and of NGOs dedicated to this issue by means of the issues that resonate most in their websites as well as those that are marginalised (maps 3 and 4). </p><p ></p><p >Another way is to repurpose search engines such as Google and its website rankings for research. As a central entry point to the web, Google&rsquo;s search algorithm takes the number of inlinks that a website receives as an indicator of reputation and orders sources accordingly, thus creating a hierarchy of information on the web. These hierarchies of information do not only reflect search engine logics but also societal dynamics. Following the position that &ldquo;We look at Google results and see society instead of Google&rdquo; (Rogers, Social Research with the Web, p. 1), search engine results and website rankings for particular queries can be used to ascertain how issues are turned into matters of concern online. A more specific position is to maintain that the Web as accessed through search engines presents itself as &ldquo;a potential collision space for alternative accounts of reality.&rdquo; (Rogers, The End of the Virtual, p. 19). </p><p ></p><p >How do these medium-specific dynamics play out in the case of climate change? How does the web account for this ongoing debate? In the case of climate change we may enquire into the sources which are privileged and which make it to the top of Google results, be they web search or image search results, as well as their nature and the issues which they carry/bear (maps 1 and 2). We may ask whether these influential sources and the issues which they bear are mainstream or if they are challenging official accounts. Are different accounts of climate change sitting side by side or do web results align with official or mainstream accounts?</p><p ></p><p >In particular our interest lies in the&nbsp;extent to which adaptation is organising climate change discourse not only in climate science (IPCC WG2 report 2014, p. 2), but in other spaces as well, as well as whether Google recognises the main responses to climate change: scepticism, mitigation, adaptation and conflict and, the hierarchy of attention which it generates towards these approaches.</p><p ></p><p >To start off, we query the keywords &lsquo;skeptic&rsquo;, &lsquo;mitigation, &lsquo;adaptation&rsquo; and &lsquo;conflict&rsquo; in the top seventeen Google results, as captured in June 2013. We find that the account of climate change organised by the top Google results aligns with official accounts from scientific literature. Similarly to the scientific space where adaptation has become a central area of research, with the volume of literature on this topic more than doubling between 2005 and 2010 (IPCC WG2 report 2014, p. 2), in the climate change web space adaptation is the most resonant issue, taking over from mitigation and scepticism in terms of resonance. The second most resonant issue, conflict, gestures towards another feature of the web, the web as an anticipatory medium (Rogers, Viagra Files), as recent years have seen conflict has emerged as a fourth discourse around climate change, where violent reactions could follow climate instability and a failure to mitigate and to adapt: &nbsp;&lsquo;<a  href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Ftemplates%2Fstory%2Fstory.php%3FstoryId%3D122195532&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqZr7zewTlWhdNLaE0x7L9UOWtVg\">Will the next war be fought over water?</a>&rsquo; &#39;<a  href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Fblogs%2Fhealth%2F2013%2F08%2F02%2F208218317%2Fcould-hotter-temperatures-from-climate-change-boost-violence&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFO-xOCKTF9yW5MeNzY2kmI4EFIlA\">Could hotter temperatures from climate change boost violence?</a>&#39; &lsquo;<a  href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2013%2F09%2F08%2F220438728%2Fhow-could-a-drought-spark-a-civil-war&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGi3giktGVPViQ1MRLUQompw_j3gA\">How could a drought spark a civil war?</a>&nbsp;(National Public Radio, 2010, 2013a, 2013b).</p><p ><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-17 at 17.57.08.png\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cx7r0vXB1Qwt0t547u3EXMBE-DrO4DCKDllwerqIW9H902HomA5pZQ2yG6bF9shfA2o5UhoIePErFTo_eVuCI-a6cRquKVy_X6lhN0_o3vyxjN8METGKArGRo1k\"  title=\"\"></p><p >Map 7.</p><p ></p><p >A second concern are the visual aesthetics of climate change which Google Image Search organise. We thus ask: What does web-based imagery of climate change add to the discourse around this topic? What matters of concern emerge from climate change imagery as accessed through Google Images? What visuals illustrate the climate change debate? The top 1000 Google Images provides us with a picture of climate change dominated by landscape imagery, in particular disasters and land and sea images (floating icebergs, dry lands), and very little human presence. Climate science is recognised in the climate change image space through graphs and maps, as well as human actors in this ongoing debate, particularly activists and decision-makers.</p><p ></p><p >Next we look at where adaptation is situated on the agendas of two important institutional actors in the climate change space, climate NGOs and the UN, and how these approaches are turned into matters of concern. We query the four dominant issues, scepticism, mitigation, adaptation and conflict, in the websites of UN&nbsp;agencies that work on climate change, and identify, similarly to the top Google results, that conflict is recognised as a prominent issue, followed closely by adaptation, and mitigation and scepticism as a distant third and fourth. </p><p ></p><p >Whereas conflict configured as a refugee care and development issue tops the UN&rsquo;s climate change agenda, for climate NGOs &lsquo;food&rsquo; emerges as a priority issue. In the case of climate NGOs we do not start with a list of predefined issues to determine their resonance, but read the issues prioritised by a network of 74 NGOs from dedicated sections on their websites. This analysis shows us that NGOs configure climate change as an environmental issue with concerns such as &lsquo;water&rsquo;, &lsquo;oil&rsquo;, &lsquo;agriculture&rsquo;, and &lsquo;conservation&rsquo; resonating most, and as a humanitarian issue, with concerns such as &lsquo;food&rsquo;, &lsquo;community&rsquo;, &lsquo;women&rsquo;, &lsquo;children&rsquo;, &lsquo;poverty&rsquo;, &lsquo;Israel&rsquo;, &lsquo;right&rsquo;, &lsquo;education&rsquo; and &lsquo;health&rsquo; being most prominent.</p><p ></p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-17 at 17.48.58.png\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7ErzTK-wwd-rVwNnKYpKOm0r6946uMWdI0twKWuVdzrqK-YsxmtaO1gE2ECmEItp4NqhHrY-95WS52gF-QO0sTCenmVLzMM4u0cdMu4YOJDRpKCAayn7x2wAoPs\"  title=\"\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-17 at 17.49.05.png\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IvosdmYGCvQh157b7N1w8NKaazdG7B_7DqMaEGccS8AfVuHw5MnD4Jsr-imma9ePuU5lC7gkpAM4HFZRpJKArkfgrS2CkOdhUcnAregl3g6rMfr50bYUKLBXavM\"  title=\"\"></p><p ></p><p ></p><p >Map 8</p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-17 at 17.49.11.png\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u82jOXgibGv2Fus8am-S3rjy0RBJT-KADFhwFQqvKEUOgUNyFTzNVasktrbnv8gwrCnR7xwndDM8PsqMyLcEduAjiLPa4pp7ZskKrPW0AJSO7uwXGkpCL90_7-k\"  title=\"\"></p><p >Map 9</p><p ></p>",

Adaptation constantly highlights the urgency of modifying our social systems and infrastructures so in the future society can cope with the changes that will inevitably come, and in which losses are already calculated. The discourse around climate-motivated conflicts presents a future in where we have failed to successfully adapt. Mitigation, perhaps the most positive, depicts a future that can be altered and a planet that can be saved, even though literature that questions the approach has already made it into the top best sellers. </p><p ></p><p >As the question of the future is urgent and complex, and in order to further delve into it, we conclude by analyzing a corpus of climate fiction or cli-fi books, which deals with worlds in which the expected disasters already took place, and adaption to climate change is an everyday practice. Moreover, climate fiction is an emerging genre that has gained attention in the media. It is characterized as providing new ways to engage with the environmental crisis, for example, by &ldquo; ..translating graphs and scientific jargon into experience and emotion.&rdquo; (Tuhus-Dubrow, 2013, np). The question of how to engage publics with the environmental crisis, especially from an emotional perspective, is an ongoing one. This is what drives the success or failure of campings and determines what resonates in people&rsquo;s imaginations. Previous research on Google images showed that landscapes and images of people are in the most popular images, what tropes are picked up in fiction? who are the protagonists? And, what are they afraid of? to what did they have to adapt?</p><p ></p><p >In order to compile a relevant corpus,&nbsp;top ranking online sources reporting on cli-fi are visited and books mentioned in them captured and triangulated, resulting in a list of 28 book titles. Each of the titles is queried in Amazom.com and the descriptions of the books, which includes plotlines, main characters and locations, subsequently collected and ran through a co-word analyser,&nbsp;in an attempt to identify climate fiction scenarios using algorithmic clustering.&nbsp;Words that bridge between clusters and themes are telling. Human relationships are amongst the most common in our graph and for the first time in the analysis words such as &lsquo;wife&rsquo;, &lsquo;companions&rsquo;, and &lsquo;family&rsquo; occupy a central position in the adaption discourse, more intimately addressing climate change not only as an environmental but also as a human crisis. And as literary tropes remain close to those basic to the human experience (love, friendship, a quest for home), the underlying questions seems to be how do they develop in these scenarios populated by destroyed metropolis, an unruly nature and new sets of issues? </p><p ></p><p >The occurrence of the words &lsquo;fears&rsquo; and &lsquo;death&rsquo; confirm the hypothesis that many of these books deal with post-apocalyptic, dystopian or otherwise dark scenarios. Protagonist are scientists facing ethical dilemmas, explorers and survivors of the climatic disasters, animals facing harsh conditions and those that love them. Cities ruined by floods and pollution are the preferred locations for these stories to develop. The narratives put forward by adaptation to climate change and the fiction that develops around it displace the urgency of the environmental crisis elsewhere. Life goes on, with new sets of urgent issues and problems, with conflicts and new and old types of wars, losers and winners in these scenarios, and the tools of policy, science and humanitarian aid to deal with it.</p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ></p><p ><img alt=\"cli_fi_bernhard.png\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/w7TBzqwEqWvr6Se8MxrEH4e5GV2G664b3YvfltbnHG2ZnyhC21PWPqKXBRdZPEI188tIHJloUxIG2BHOzlNjRsvsZRfYYg85zPsagouMm5-lowkHbql0V_xIZ8M\"  title=\"\"></p><p >Map 14</p><p ></p><p >A final map is produced.

More tweets are published about adaption than mitigation, hastags organize clusters around victims and vulnerable places, while mainstream discourse moves away from emissions and harmful gases to humans and food security. Violent conflicts motivated by climatic instability are also shaping the online information space around climate change, with news sources and mainstream literature increasingly reporting on it, where to mourning for the coming lost of our familiar landscapes and the fear of natural disasters, narratives around climate change are also prominently now including a growing fear of each other.</p><p ></p><p >References</p><p ></p><h3 ><a ></a></h3>",
