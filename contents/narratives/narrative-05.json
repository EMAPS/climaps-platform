They make free choices as to how to allocate their bilateral aid for adaptation, but have now started to label it as such. We therefore wanted to understand how and why the countries&rsquo; aid distribution varies. We did this, firstly by identifying and visualizing the donor countries&rsquo; investment portfolios, such as through documenting the amount of money they commit and to whom. This then revealed some interesting patterns of funding and illustrates that the different donor countries have different funding styles. Particularly the maps illustrate interesting patterns in terms of the prefered sectoral areas donors provide bilateral adaptation aid to, as well as the number of countries they fund. Furthermore, there appears to differences between donor countries in concentrated they chose for their aid to be, on either a few or many recipient countries or areas. We have also revealed interesting patterns in terms of donors having favoured recipient countries, partly related to the vulnerability ranking of the recipient country, but also in terms of political and historical relationships between donor and recipient countries. </span></p><h1 class=\"c3 c4\"><a name=\"h.ixp71ve6nwrj\"></a><span>Narrative</span></h1><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\"></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Research questions: you&rsquo;ll answer them using the presented maps</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Maps and texts alternated (put maps screenshoots in the document)</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">if needed, insert contextual static visualizations</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Conclusions and future works</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Highlights in bold relevant sentences</span></p><h1 class=\"c3 c4\"><a name=\"h.i2r2ts1260tx\"></a><span>Section title</span></h1><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">You can divide your narrative into several sections</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\"></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">For each map, describe:</span></p><p class=\"c3 c6\"><span class=\"c2\">how the map is linked to research questions</span></p><p class=\"c3 c6\"><span class=\"c2\">explanation of what you can read in the visualization about the topic</span></p><p class=\"c3 c6\"><span class=\"c2\">biases related to topic (if any)</span></p><p class=\"c3 c6\"><span class=\"c2\">findings</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\"></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">For each map include a short subtitle contextualizing it.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>The maps have therefore been grouped and discussed according to </span><span>three key themes in terms of patterns of funding; &lsquo;concentration and specialisation&rsquo;, &lsquo;vulnerability&rsquo; and &lsquo;relationships&rsquo;.

The concentration of OECD member countries&rsquo; bilateral adaptation aid. The relationship between the number of adaptation areas and the number of countries the donor countries provide bilateral adaptation aid to and the amount of aid they provide. The size of the node indicates the amount of money given. Countries in the bottom left hand corner of the scatterplot concentrate their funding highly; they fund a small number of &nbsp;countries and adaptation areas. Countries in the top right hand corner, by contrast, concentrate their funding minimally; they fund both a high number of countries and areas. Source of the data: stats.oecd.org. Date: January 6, 2014.</span></h5><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>Figure 1</span><span>&nbsp;shows that the different donor countries have very different patterns in terms of how concentrated their adaptation aid is on a few or multiple different adaptation areas and recipient countries, which appears to be loosely correlated with the overall amount of money they donate; countries which commit less adaptation aid tend to give to a fewer number of recipients countries as well as adaptation areas (e.g. Portugal, Czech Republic, Greece), whilst larger funders such as the United Kingdom and Japan provide to a reasonably large number of both adaptation areas and countries. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>However, there are exceptions to this common-sense rule. For example, t</span><span>he Netherlands concentrates its aid on few countries and few areas. This appears to be as a result of a &nbsp;political decision made by the Dutch government in order </span><span class=\"c15\"><a class=\"c10\" href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.government.nl%2Fissues%2Fdevelopment-cooperation&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH35IP1MGvF-8Dbd0HvUTiqNT3FUg\">to render its aid more efficient.</a></span><span>&nbsp;Chose carefully whom you give to, and for what purpose: this could be the motto of this distribution pattern. The EU institutions seem to have made it theirs as well.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>Another anomaly, on the other end of the spectrum, is Spain. They provide, overall, less adaptation aid than the Netherlands, yet donate their aid to the highest number of recipient countries among all OECD donor. Further they are the 6th highest country in terms of the number of adaptation areas they fund.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>An intermediate choice seems to be that of Korea, whose total amount of aid is in the same range as the Netherlands and Spain. The number of recipient countries of the Netherlands and Korea are similar so they are aligned vertically; the number of areas of Korea and Spain are similar, so they are aligned horizontally. Korea seems to favor a low number of recipient countries, while being more liberal as concerns the areas it wants to foster.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>Irrespective of the amount of money they commit to, two groups of countries stand out : Germany, Canada and Japan and the United Kingdom on one side; Australia, Italy, Switzerland, France and Norway on the other side.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>It is important to be aware that a potential bias with the data. Because the donor countries themselves code which funds (Official Development Assistance)</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt1\" name=\"ftnt_ref1\">[1]</a></sup><span>, it has resulted in an underreporting of aid defined as for &lsquo;adaptation&rsquo; by some countries. For example, the US who, despite being one of the top contributors to Fast Start Finance (</span><span class=\"c12\">cf. ODI&#39;s Mobilising International Climate Finance</span><span>), report insignificant adaptation aid to the OECD DAC. This is a political issue, according to many researchers, who emphasise that this method of coding can result in the donor countries&rsquo; decision to define their donation as &lsquo;adaptation&rsquo; is partly informed by whether they need to demonstrate the additional nature of adaptation funding, justify that their commitments have been met or look for easily verifiable adaptation outcomes.</span></p><h1 class=\"c3 c4\"><a name=\"h.rhziwy1seuu5\"></a><span>Specialization: do donor countries have favourite areas of intervention?</span></h1><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>As a result of the caveat outlined above</span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;</span><span>it is difficult to know to what extent the amount of money committed to adaptation by donor countries is real or subject to a &ldquo;political&rdquo; bias.

It is interesting to note that biodiversity seems an important adaptation concern within the UK.

Coming back to Japan,areas that it &ldquo;owns&rdquo; include Disaster prevention and preparedness, Material relief assistance and services and reconstruction relief &amp; rehabilitation. The project data show only 6 projects financed by Japan between 2010 and 2012 but they are important in financial terms (areas affected by Typhoons in Philippines for example). </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>One can now understand why the coding is problematic : are relief and reconstruction processes after a natural disaster a part of adaptation to climate change ? Does Japan count wrongly its humanitarian aid in Fast Track Finance &nbsp;? It can be assumed than Japan &ldquo;overcodes&rdquo; adaptation aid, but it could alternatively be speculated that this is the Japanese funding style, and the Japanese version of climate change adaptation - coping with natural disasters - as much as other styles co-exist. For example, the German version of adaptation would be solving the future of agriculture (agricultural land resources, rural development, forestry development, agricultural research) the Canadian version, searching new energy sources (wind power, solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass&hellip;), or the UK version, protecting biodiversity.</span></p><h1 class=\"c3 c4\"><a name=\"h.lbh26p6x4swc\"></a><span>Vulnerability : does funding seem to be attributed according to vulnerability?</span></h1><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>If the reader is not convinced by this pragmatic approach, he/she would maybe like to get a more objective analysis of the political decisions made by the donor countries in attributing and reporting their adaptation aid. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>The allocation of adaptation funding is a contentious problem which requires the attention of the international community to define what a fair distribution funds is between donors and receivers of the aid (Ciplet</span><span class=\"c13\">&nbsp;et al</span><span>&nbsp;2013). Funding goes through many different channels, notably multilateral funds or bilateral funding which has been overwhelming favoured by the donor countries so far, since &ldquo;it allows greater opportunity to align priorities and interests with national priorities. It also gives greater flexibility to projects and ideas not as easily negotiated through the multilateral channels.&rdquo; (Jones </span><span class=\"c13\">et al</span><span>&nbsp;2012).

One of the biases of this network visualization is that the smaller contributors have a tendancy to be rejected on the margins of the map. This is the case of the United States, as they report few adaptation aid to OECD DAC, which are located far away from the central cluster. Its closest receiving grouping are the League of Arab States and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its closest donor neighbour, Greece.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span></span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>Yet, some big contributors are also located outside the central cluster : Ireland and the Uk (which are close to each other), Canada and Germany.
